**First move the air, then cool it**

**_Electric fans as alternative or augmentation to air conditioning for mitigation and adaptation to climate change._**

_Prof Stefano Schiavon_

**Presentation Abstract**

We spend most of our time in built spaces that substantially affect our health, well-being, and productivity. Conditioning the built environment has a large influence on climate change, most of which comes from the energy used to create indoor comfort. The need for cooling has been increasing globally, with most of it happening in tropical countries because of their economic and demographic growth. In this poster, we will show that in spite of this energy, buildings are registering high levels of thermal discomfort among their occupants, even in green and high performance buildings. How can we enhance occupant satisfaction without increasing buildings' environmental impact even further? And better yet, could we reduce our reliance on air conditioning? Modern electric fans can be both an alternative to and augmentation of air conditioning. In a remarkable number of ways, they have the potential to simultaneously reduce energy use and increase thermal comfort.

**Speaker’s Profile**

Stefano Schiavon, PhD, is Associate Professor of Architecture at UC Berkeley and Associate Director of CEDR. Stefano’s research is focused on finding ways to reduce energy consumption in buildings while improving occupant health, well-being, and productivity. He received a PhD in Energy Engineering and an MS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Padova, Italy.

**Improving the safety of Li-ion batteries**

_Prof Zhichuan (Jason) Xu_

**Presentation Abstract**

Internal short circuit resulted from the growth of lithium dendrites on the low-potential anode is a major cause for the safety issues of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). For example, the denritite growth may occur on graphite anode during charging and thus most countries do not allow charging the personal mobile devices in house. Fully addressing the growth of lithium dendrites remains a great challenge. Here we introduce a double-anode approach to completely stop the growth of lithium dendrites. We introduce a second anode in LIBs which works as an anode only when there is the growth of lithium dendrites. After dendritic growth, Li+ can be taken by the second anode instead of further growing dendrites to reach the cathode which leads to a short circuit. We discuss the working principle and design a multiple-electrode cell to demonstrate the effectiveness. With the feature of stopping the growth of lithium dendrites, we anticipate that this approach will largely reduce the self-immolation incidence of EVs, cellphones, laptops and other devices that use LIBs.
