The Human Systems (i.e. inflammation, infectious diseases, biosystems and micromechanics) is one out of four interdisciplinary thematic areas of research for CREATE that was chosen to be part of an overarching theme of system of systems. The following research centres carry out research in the field of Human Systems:

*   [Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Inflammation (SHARE-MMID)](https://share.create.edu.sg/about-create/research-centres/nus-huj-create/)
*   [SMART Antimicrobial Resistance (SMART-AMR)](https://smart.create.edu.sg/about-create/research-centres/smart/)
*   [SMART Biosystems and Micromechanics (SMART-BioSyM)](https://smart.create.edu.sg/about-create/research-centres/smart/)
