Optoelectronic Imaging and its applications
-------------------------------------------

### by Dr Chen Wen

### Seminar Abstract

Optoelectronic imaging has attracted much attention in various fields, such as microscopy and security. Nowadays, a number of optoelectronic imaging systems have been developed, such as based on digital holography, phase retrieval algorithms, diffractive imaging and single-pixel imaging. In this talk, various optoelectronic imaging systems will be introduced, and imaging principles are presented. The potential applications, such as optical encoding  
and authentication, are discussed.
