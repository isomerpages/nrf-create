Dear all,

A gentle reminder for the monthly Seminar Series by CREATE PIs on **1 Jul 2016**, 11am, CREATE Seminar Room. The speakers are Prof George Barbastathis and Prof Tonio Buonassisi from SMART. We hope to see you there. Thank you.

  

**Abstract for Prof Tonio Buonassisi’s talk: Creating sustaining economic value through strategic R&D in new high-value energy technologies**

In the post-WWII era, United States federal R&D expenditures (as % of federal budget) peaked in the 1960’s and have been slowly declining since the mid-1970’s. In the modern era of increased global competition, slower economic growth, and increased constraints on natural resources, the _need_ for technological innovation has never been greater, yet the _resources_ to finance the necessary R&D have never been scarcer. This has contributed to a decreasing focus on foundational R&D, with resulting opportunity cost in innovation, wealth creation, and quality of life. Responding to this need, we describe an emergent R&D model focused on maximizing R&D return on investment. We highlight an R&D area of great importance to humanity, but fundamentally challenging economics: solar photovoltaics, the conversion of sunlight into electricity. Research in my laboratory begins with bottom-up technoeconomic analyses to identify key technology drivers affecting cost and scale. We then develop medium- and near-term technical priority research areas and experimental plans, in consultation with industry. The outputs of our R&D have resulted in innovations that were successfully translated to start-up and established industrial partners, contributing to fundamental changes in industry and billions in additional investment. I cultivate a longer-term R&D program within my laboratory, grounded in research directions identified by the applied R&D. In discussion, I’ll share my vision for one possible future of RD&D, including extension of the current model to system-level analysis, engaging new financial entities. I’ll share my perspective on the natural advantages and future opportunities for Singapore in this modern RD&D landscape, in an era when “return on investment” is highly valued.
