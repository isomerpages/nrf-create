Event Date: 29 Aug 2019 01:00 AM - 11 Sep 2019 10:00 AM

Event Venue: Singapore City Gallery (URA Centre)

The exhibition at the Singapore City Gallery at the URA presents the outcomes of the _Grand Projet_ research project at the Future Cities Laboratory, based on a comparative analysis of eight urban mega project case studies in Asia and Europe. It also brings in the perspectives of a broad range of stakeholders involved in the making of _Grands Projets_.

With a focus on the spatial practices of _Grands Projets_, the research aims to not only broaden the scholarship of urban mega projects but also to provide applicable insights for planners, managers, policymakers and other urban actors.

Additionally, the research, as exhibited and presented in a book, seeks to provide in-depth knowledge for those interested in a particular city or case study and new comparative urban studies.

With these intentions, the body of work speaks to multiple audiences about the possibilities _Grands Projets_ offer for creating more inclusive and adaptable urban conditions.
