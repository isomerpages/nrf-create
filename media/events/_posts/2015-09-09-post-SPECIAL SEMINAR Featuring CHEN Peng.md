Title: Nanorods: High efficiency structure for GaN-based lighting device

Abstract:

Nitride nanorods are almost dislocation free and can present excellent optical qualities such as strong PL emission and low threshold stimulated emission. Therefore applying this nanorod or nanocolumn technology to InGaN Multiple Quantum Wells (MQW) may bring about an improvement in photoluminescence quality. In this work, InGaN/GaN MQW embedded in the nanorods were fabricated. The diameters of the nanorods are from 100 nm to 300 nm, and the lengths of the nanorods are from 300 nm to 1400 nm. We measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these samples and then calculated the light emission enhancement. It was found that the light emission of the MQW in the nanorods have been greatly enhanced compared to the planar MQW. PL measurements demonstrated a maximum light emission enhancement factor of more than 10 in the integral intensity. The trend of the PL enhancement factor increment with the nanorod structure were discussed. Higher radiative recombination efficiency in the nanorod structure has great potential to prepare high efficiency optoelectronic devices for future advanced device design.
