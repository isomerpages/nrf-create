**Sensitivity, robustness, and modulation of neuronal behaviors: a feedback story**

**Speaker: Prof R. Sepulchre, University of Cambridge**

Friday 29th Jan 2016

2pm – 3pm, CREATE Seminar Room (Level 2).

**Abstract:**

Reliable neuron activity is ensured by a tight regulation of  ion channels expression. Understanding the causal mechanisms that relate this regulation to physiological and pathological neuronal activity is a necessary step for developing efficient therapies for neurological diseases associated with abnormal nervous system activity. We will discuss a novel methodological framework to quantify the sensitivity of neuronal activity to changes in ion channel densities, either from a detailed conductance-based model or from voltage-clamped experimental data. We will illustrate the generality of the framework and its potential to improve our understanding of the regulation of brain functions and to help in the design of new pharmacological treatments.
