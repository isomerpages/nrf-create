To help translate these assets into the innovative products and services that support a knowledge- based economy, in collaboration with MIT the Institute has developed novel entrepreneurship programs using a systems engineering approach. A key part of this approach involves structuring the innovation ecosystem of outside stakeholders, resources and rules so as to accelerate university-based innovation.
