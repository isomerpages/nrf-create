The Importance Of Energy Storage in a Changing Energy World  
  
Prof Ulrich Stimming  
Chemistry – School of Natural and Environmental Sciences, Newcastle University  
  
Abstract  
  
It is an important goal to gradually substitute energy conversion based on fossil fuels by one that is based on regenerative energy sources. As a consequence, electricity production moves from a centralized (one producer and many consumers) to a decentralized (many producers and many consumers) operation. Thus, a revised architecture of energy systems seems necessary. Such novel architectures need to be supported by technical possibilities, a central one being that there are suitable electricity storage devices. This is pertinent for stationary as well as mobile applications. Criteria are volumetric and gravimetric energy and power density, depending on the specific application, and costs. Examples will be given for stationary applications in the form of Redox Flow Batteries and for mobile applications which is mostly with Li-Ion Batteries.  
  
  
About the speaker  
  
Ulrich Stimming is currently Professor of Physical Chemistry at Newcastle University, United Kingdom. Previously, he was Head of the School of Chemistry at Newcastle University. He was CEO and Scientific Advisor and Principal Investigator of TUM Create in Singapore. He had a Chair of Technical Physics and was Professor of Chemistry at Technical University Munich (TUM). Prior to that he was a director at the Research Center Jülich and before a member of the faculty of Columbia University in New York, U.S.A. He has visiting appointments at various universities including Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).  
  
Currently, he is the director of the Northeast Centre of Energy Materials (NECEM) funded by EPSRC. He also directs a large battery project at Newcastle University on degradation of Li-Ion batteries in cooperation with Cambridge, UCL and Glasgow universities. Prof. Stimming is the founder and Editor-in-chief of the scientific journal “Fuel Cells-From Fundamentals to Systems”, VCH-Wiley. He was the co-director of the Joint “Institute for Advanced Power Sources” of TU Munich and Tsinghua University, Beijing, from 2010-2014.  
  
Prof. Stimming was educated at the Free University of Berlin, Germany, where he received his Diploma degree in Chemistry and a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry. He has 300+ publications, numerous patents and awards.

Electromobility in Singapore – Where we are today  
  
Dr Tobias Massier  
Principal Investigator, TUMCREATE  
  
Abstract  
  
When TUMCREATE was launched in 2010, electromobility, i.e. electric road transport was a hot topic in Singapore. Eight years and two electric vehicle test-beds later, the number of electric cars in Singapore is still low. However, in the transition to more shared mobility and public transport usage, electromobility is getting more and more attractive. In a future car-lite Singapore, passenger transport can be fully electric.  
  
The talk focuses on past and current events and activities concerning electromobility in Singapore, and TUMCREATE’s work on charging of electric vehicles and their integration into the power system.  
  
About the Speaker  
  
Tobias Massier received his diploma and his doctoral degree from Technische Universität München in 2002 and 2010 respectively. He worked on the structural analysis of analogue integrated circuits. In 2009, he took over the position of programme manager for the new Master programme in Power Engineering (MSPE) at Technische Universität München. In 2013, he joined TUM CREATE as Principal Investigator of Research Project 8 – Energy Management, now Electrification Suite and Test Lab (ESTL).  
  
His research focuses on charging infrastructure and scheduling of electric vehicles and integration of electromobility into the grid.
