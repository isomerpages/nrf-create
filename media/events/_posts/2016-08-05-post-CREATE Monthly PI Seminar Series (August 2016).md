Join us at the monthly Seminar Series by CREATE PIs on 05 August 2016, 11am at the CREATE Seminar Room. The speakers are Prof Paulo Monteiro and Prof Kameshwa Poolla from BEARS. We hope to see you there!

**Prof Paulo Monteiro- High resolution imaging of materials using synchrotron radiation**

Our research group has been using synchrotron radiation to characterize and optimize the nano and microstructure of advanced construction materials.Â  I will discuss how three-dimensional tomographic images are providing fresh new insights into the complex nature of composite materials and how this information can be used in the design of improved materials. The lecture will also cover the exciting goal of producing x-ray images with a spatial resolution of 1 nm.

**Prof Kameshwa Poolla- The New Sharing Economy for the Grid 2050**

The sharing economy. It is all the rage. Going on vacation? Rent out your home for extra income! Not using your car. Rent it out for extra income! Companies such as AirBnB and Uber have disrupted housing and transportation sectors. Their innovative business models are based on resource sharing that leverage underutilized infrastructure. They are enabled by peer-to-peer platforms that match eager sellers with willing buyers.

Are there compelling sharing economy opportunities in the electricity sector? What products can be shared in tomorrow's Smart Grid? Could consumers trade electricity via online matching markets? We explore three sharing economy opportunities in the electricity sector - sharing storage, sharing PV generation, and sharing recruited demand flexibility. We discuss regulatory and technical challenges to these opportunities. We conduct a micro-economic analysis of decisions by firms, and quantify the benefits of sharing to various participants.
