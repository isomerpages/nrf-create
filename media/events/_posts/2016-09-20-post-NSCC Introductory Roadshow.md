Event Venue: CREATE Seminar Room, Level 2, CREATE Tower

Dear all,

The National Super Computing Centre (NSCC) will be convening an introductory roadshow at the CREATE Seminar Room on the 20thÂ of September from 9am to 12pm. This roadshow builds on the conversations and discussions from CREATE's recent visit to NSCC, and aims to engage CREATE-based users and to gauge the amount of resources needed for current and future research projects.

All are welcome, and we hope that you could pass on this message to your colleagues.

  
Thanks!
