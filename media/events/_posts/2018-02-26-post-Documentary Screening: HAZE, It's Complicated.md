**About the film**

“HAZE, It’s Complicated…” presents the scientific facts behind the issue of peat haze as well as a variety of points of view from local and regional stakeholders.

The burning of the peat forests throughout tropical Southeast Asia creates haze pollution, and this has posed significant challenges to human health and the economies of the region during the second decade of the 21st century.

The intensive farming of oil palm throughout tropical Southeast Asia requires land, and peat forests have been cleared often times with government support to make room for both industrial and small holder farming. The solution to the complex issue of haze pollution will not be a simple one.

The peat haze problem has been somewhat mitigated in recent years but in spite of this positive progress a few of the critical issues are yet to be solved.
