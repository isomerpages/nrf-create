How can we improve the energy performance of cities? What resources, technologies and overall strategies are needed to supply the future demand of cities in a sustainable and economically viable manner?

The Urban Energy Systems executive course 2018 at the [**Future Cities Laboratory**](https://www.fcl.ethz.ch/) will provide an introduction to the  analysis of urban energy systems with the City Energy Analyst (CEA). The CEA is one of the first open-source tools for the analysis of energy efficiency strategies in districts.

Through theoretical and hands-on exercises, participants will learn how to use advanced numerical methods in CEA to estimate and optimise the performance of an actual district in Singapore. Participants will examine strategies ranging from building retrofits, integration of renewable energy, district energy, and modifications of urban form.
