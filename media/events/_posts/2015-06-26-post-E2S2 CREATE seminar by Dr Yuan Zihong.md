E2S2-CREATE Seminar
===================

A Simplicial Complex Model for Large Shared Scientific Data Repositories
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### byÂ  Dr Yuan Zihong

**Seminar Abstract:**  
We present a data model and language for the management of large shared repositories of scientific data. The data model is one of grids. It is appropriate not only for simple array data, as it is the case with measurements given as input to scientific workflows, but also a grid data, as it is the case with intermediary data produced by simulation, visualization and optimization processes.
