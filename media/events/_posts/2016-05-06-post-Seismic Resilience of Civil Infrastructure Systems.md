**FRS Lunch Talk: Seismic Resilience of Civil Infrastructure Systems: A Structural Engineer’s View**

After sustainability, resilience is the most valued quality of communities today. Community social and economic functions are supported by civil infrastructure systems including water supply, electric power, transportation and communications. A resilient civil infrastructure system is one that recovers its functions after it is disabled by a natural disaster such as an earthquake.

Engineering resilient civil infrastructure systems requires a method to measure their resilience, a resilience acceptance criterion, and engineering measures to affect resilience.

In this talk, Dr Božidar Stojadinovic will present a supply-demand framework to model the resilience of a civil infrastructure system that involves component vulnerability and recovery functions and a model of system operation.

He will present two classes of systemic resilience measures, examine how to evaluate them probabilistically, and present options to develop resilience acceptance criteria. He will conclude with a discussion on the process to design resilient civil infrastructure systems and point out where and how a structural engineer can contribute in this systemic effort. 

Dr Božidar Stojadinovic is the Chair of Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering at ETH Zurich – the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.
