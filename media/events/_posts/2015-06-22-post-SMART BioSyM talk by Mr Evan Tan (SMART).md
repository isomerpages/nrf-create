Role of JAG1-extracellular vesicles on angiogenesis
---------------------------------------------------

### By Mr Evan Tan

**Seminar Abstract**  
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are novel mediators of cellular signaling. They are able to ferry growth factors, receptors, nucleic acids and lipid mediators.Â  Studies involving tumor-derived EVs have shown that they have been able to promote tumor progression. They are able to promote angiogenesis, tumor proliferation and metastasis. Jagged1(JAG1), a key notch ligand involved in angiogenesis, has been shown to be up-regulated in several metastatic cancers. In breast cancers, tumor-derived JAG1 promotes bone metastasis. High levels of JAG1 and Notch1 co-expression in breast cancer patients is associated with poorer overall survival. In prostate cancer, down-regulation of Notch1 and JAG1 resulted in an inhibition of cell growth, migration and invasion while promoting cell death. Hence, tumor-derived JAG1-EVs could potentially be a novel mediator of tumor progression by regulating angiogenesis.
