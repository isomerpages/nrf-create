**Seminar Abstract**  
Single-cell assay becomes increasingly attractive because it reveals the function and behavior of individual cells in a population of heterogeneous cells. It enables the investigation of rare cell subgroup, whose cell signals are usually masked by average response from cell population. Here, we intend to study protease secretion activity of single viable tumor cells using droplet microfluidic platform. The functional assay is achieved by encapsulating cancer cells into picoliter droplets in oil environment together with fluorescent substrate. Protease secreted from cancer cells cleaves the polypeptide target of the substrate and releases fluorophores that bright up cell-containing droplets. This droplet-based platform helps us understand various protease secretion activities of different cancer cell lines and can be potentially applied on the study of patient-derived cell sample for better diagnosis and prognosis.  
  
**Speaker's Biography**  
Mr. Tengyang Jing is currently a PhD student and recipient of SMART fellowship at the National University of Singapore (NUS). He has received his B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering in 2011 from NUS. His research interests lie in microfluidics for cell assay, especially for single-cell analysis.
