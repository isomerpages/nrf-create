### Multi-Tier Sensing Analytics  
by Prof Tham Chen Khong, E2S2-CREATE

#### Seminar Abstract:

The Energy and Environmental Sustainability Solutions (E2S2) programme considers waste to energy conversion and the detection of emerging contaminants, together with the modelling, sensing and computing aspects to support these. With the proliferation of sensing data from a multitude of sensors, the need arises to process and analyse these sensor data, not just to derive insights in an offline manner, but also in a real-time manner so as to affect the ongoing process or phenomenon. Traditionally, processing takes place in the back-end at servers or in the cloud at data centers. While this approach is suitable for offline processing, it is not ideal for real-time sensor data analytics. In this presentation, we describe the edge analytics approach adopted in the E2S2 programme which enables scalable real-time sensor data analytics.

### Building Efficiency and Sustainability in the Tropics

### by Prof Sanjib Panda, SinBerBEST

#### Seminar Abstract:

Over the past decade, promoting energy conservation through greener, smarter, more efficient buildings has moved to the front burners of nations around the world. But the issues are especially pressing here in Singapore. First, because energy-consuming buildings are such a dominant part of this urban nation. In many ways, Singapore is all about its built environment. Second, because this tropical climate is so warm and humid, we spend a disproportionate amount of energy cooling and dehumidifying that built environment. In this presentation, an overview of various research works being carried out at SinBerBEST to improve energy efficiency of the built environment without sacrificing the user comfort will be presented.
