Diversity of DNA structures under high tension
==============================================

**by Dr Xinghua Zhang**  

**Seminar Abstract**  
DNA has multiple structures depending on conditions. Previous single-molecule studies revealed that mechanical stretching of force could induce formation of overstretched DNA structures from the most common B-form DNA structure. Three possible structures have been proposed and debated for 17 years, namely:  1) peeled ssDNA, 2) DNA bubble, and 3) S-DNA.  By thermodynamics, mechanical and electrostatic studies, we have successfully identified all the three proposed structures. We also found interconversions between overstretched DNA structures can be induced by changing buffer conditions.  
The published papers were highlighted by Biopolymer on Volume 97(8), released twice by NUS Science Press Releases, and reported by dozens of medias. Currently, we are studying the physiological functions of the three overstretched DNA structures, and explore the presence of any new DNA structures under both force and torque.
