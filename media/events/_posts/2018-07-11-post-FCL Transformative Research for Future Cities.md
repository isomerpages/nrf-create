Future Cities Laboratory is launching an ambitious vision to create a global network focussed on transformative research on future cities. We invite you to help shape it at this symposium.

The world is undergoing a profound transformation that will see an additional 2.5 billion people living in cities by 2050. The vast majority of these will be in Asia and Africa. How will the future cities that will accommodate these urbanising populations be designed? Who will plan and build them? How will they be managed and inhabited? What new paradigms will be required for sustainable collective life?

Current resource-intensive norms cannot provide the credible answers. Existing silo-thinking cannot deliver the innovation that is necessary. We call for research that actively stewards and guides the transformation that urbanisation will bring, which intensive collaboration. FCL proposes a research network based on the values of collaboration, building on foundations established by FCL in Singapore and ETH Zurich in Switzerland, with the support of many partners in government, academia, industry and civil society

At the Transformative Research for Future Cities symposium, FCL will showcase cutting-edge transformative research, each of the three cases setting out the transformative, methodological and practical aspects of the research. 

Distinguished speakers include:
* **Ms Chan Hui Min**, Director, DP Architects  
* **Mr Chiu Wen Tung**, Group Director, Urban Redevelopment Authority  
* **Mr Ridwan Kamil**, Mayor of Bandung  
* **Ms Jyoti Shukla**, Director, Singapore Infrastructure and Urban Development Hub, World Bank 
* **Dr Bambang Susantono,** VP for Knowledge Management, Asian Development Bank
* **Dr Johnny Wong**, Group Director, Housing & Development Board

The symposium will be moderated by Ms Karishma Vaswani.
