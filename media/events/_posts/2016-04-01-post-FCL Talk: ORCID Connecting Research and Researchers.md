[ORCID](http://orcid.org/)Â (Open Researcher & Contributor ID) is a non-profit organization driving an international initiative to provide a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher. ORCID works with more than 400 member organisations in a variety of systems such as researcher profile services, journal publishers, manuscript submission systems, institutional repositories, grant management systems, and more.

This talk will introduce how ORCID identifiers are being used in different stages of scholarly communication, and how you can exploit ORCID during the progress of your research career.
