Singapore is warmer than it has to be—by as much as 7°C in some places—due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which tends to afflict high-densely cities. Global climate change and urbanisation can cause urban temperatures to rise even further, with the potential to hit levels that could threaten liveability, health, and the economy.

The Cooling Singapore intra-CREATE project, established in 2017, was initiated to find means to mitigate UHI and improve outdoor thermal comfort (OTC). One of the key tasks of the team is to establish a UHI task force consisting representatives from academia and government agencies, who can provide important insights from different perspective. At the symposium, the team will propose the next step - an ambitious plan to put the mitigation of the UHI effect  and improvement of OTC on the national agenda.

The Cooling Singapore Symposium will open with a keynote speech by Mr Peter Ho, senior advisor to the Centre for Strategic Futures and chairman of the Urban Redevelopment Authority. The project’s principal investigators, Prof Dr Gerhard Schmitt and Prof Dr Peter Edwards, will present findings and recommendations by the team. Finally, a panel discussion with experts from academia, industry, and government agency will reflect on Cooling Singapore and issues surrounding UHI and OTC.

The multidisciplinary research project is led by the Singapore-ETH Centre in collaboration with colleagues from the National University of Singapore, SMART (Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology), and TUMCREATE (established by Technical University of Munich) and funded by the National Research Foundation’s CREATE.
