Science, Technology and Policy Workshop: The Future of Work

**16 - 20 July 2018 | CREATE Tower, Singapore**

The Science, Technology and Policy (STP) Workshop brings together graduate students from Singapore, Europe and the United States to jointly explore the role and impact of science and technology in public policy, and to contextualise this understanding based on the realities in Singapore as it plans for the future.

In its third year, the STP workshop puts the spotlight on science, technology and policy issues related to Industry 4.0, namely: artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, robotics, and governing disruptive changes. Specifically, participants will be exposed to topics including the implication of industry 4.0 on the future of work, education and skills training, and on governance.

The workshop is jointly organised by the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC), Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and TUMCREATE (established by Technical University of Munich). It is hosted by the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE), a programme under Singapore’s National Research Foundation.

Objectives
==========

The objectives of the workshop are to:

*   Expose graduate students to issues at the intersection of technology and policy faced by Singapore’s government. These insights will help students in their research in technology policy and may open new research directions for faculty and students.
*   Advance discussion about the policy implications of the smart nation initiative, in particular as they relate to data governance.
*   Contribute to the larger effort of building a technology and policy focus in universities in Singapore, in conjunction with ETH Zurich, MIT, and TU Munich.

Key Themes
==========

1.  **Optimising an intelligent workforce:** limitations and advantages of AI systems, review of various technologies in academia and industry with consideration of the evolving role of human intelligence in the workforce.
2.  **Securing a connected workforce**: data sharing implications, data sharing laws, risks and benefits from automated additive manufacturing pipelines
3.  **Robotics and mobility at work**: Smart Mobility, National Robotics Program, Autonomous Vehicles
4.  **Governing disruptive changes:** managing the ambitions and fears associated with advances in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence in Singapore’s context

Programme
=========

The programme is developed to help students understand the complexities of formulating policies at the interface of science and technology. Over the course of five days, participants will be introduced to issues and key players in the areas of AI, cybersecurity, robotics, and disruptive changes.

A series of presentations, dialogues, and site visits will provide ample opportunities to

interact with representatives from government agencies, academia, and industry, and allow students to apply their knowledge to a policy-relevant context.

Participants will consolidate their understanding of the overarching themes through debates and group discussions, where they will jointly develop their analysis and solutions for assigned topics, including:

1.  Impact of AI on decision making
2.  Impact of robotics on the future of work
3.  Role of education and human development in the face of disruptive technologies
4.  Impact of disruptive technologies on Governance: Cybersecurity
5.  Impact of disruptive technologies on Governance: Ethics

The students will compile their findings and recommendations for the above topics in a written report, to be presented on the final day, with agency representatives and decision-makers joining in the ensuing discussion.
