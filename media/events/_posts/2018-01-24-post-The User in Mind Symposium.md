How do practicing architects and planners design for and anticipate user needs? How can cutting-edge academic research on spatial cognition and behaviour be translated into design policy? What new research directions in human behaviour can help create better policies and guidelines for the design of buildings or districts?

This symposium brings together multidisciplinary perspectives from cognitive science, policy, and practice to explore how research intersects with the practice of architecture and urban design.
