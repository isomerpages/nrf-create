**Seminar Abstract**  
The concern of our contemporary society which confronts us on a daily basis inside the present horizon is the future of urban development : a total metropolisation of the territory by an inexorable and uncontrollable densification.  
  
This vision is negatively implanted in the mind, losing the quality of the social relationships in which we live and we evolve. How can history inform the constitution of the city when the accumulation of this ‘built field’ gradually destroys the landscapes and the “Nature” in the deep sense of the term?  
  
The history of the Western cities, from this point of view, shows precisely that the densification always constitutes the major vector of the formation of the cities and urban communities.  
  
But the question of density is related initially to the ‘habitability’, in the broad sense, of the contemporary territories creating social cohesion.  
  
From this point of view density is not actually a problem of densification, but a question of territorial coherence. The book in the course of publication “Density as model of sustainable development”, subject of the lecture tackles these questions from five major topics in five European cities:  
– density as a territorial question  
– program for the territories  
– landscapes of the density  
– new residential typologies  
– economy of the territories and process  
  
Today, Architecture is in question through these topics which constitute a fundamental approach for the sustainable development of our modern societies.
