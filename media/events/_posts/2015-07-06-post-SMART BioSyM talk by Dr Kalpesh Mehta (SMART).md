Spread spectrum method based diffuse optical tomography for brain imaging
----------------------------------------------------
### By Dr Kalpesh Mehta (SMART-BioSyM)

**Seminar Abstract**  
Extraction of functional information such as bimolecular information are important in biological applications, as they are the precursor to the structural changes in tissues. In my talk I will discuss about novel diffuse optical imaging system as a modality to extract the hemodynamic information.  
  
Conventional diffuse optical imaging system uses pulse laser as a source. Use of pulse laser makes system design bulky and expensive. In our work we have proposed novel spread spectrum method based diffuse optical tomography system. The proposed system is fast, compact and accurate. The proposed system has been used for the brain imaging applications to monitor the cognitive state.
