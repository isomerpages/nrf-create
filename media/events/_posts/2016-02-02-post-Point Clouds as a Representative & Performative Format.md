**FCL Lunch Talk: Point Clouds as a Representative & Performative Format**

A Case Study of the Ciliwung River in Jakarta, Indonesia
by Ervine Lin, PhD researcher at the Future Cities Laboratory at the Singapore-ETH Centre

This talk investigates the opportunities and challenges of using reality capture point cloud data simultaneously as a representative and performative format for landscape architecture. It does so by examining the issues revolving around the ailing Ciliwung River which flows through Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.

  
The Ciliwung has borne witness to alarming urban growth with a multitude of factors placing tremendous pressure on the river. This has resulted in an increase in the frequency and magnitude of devastating floods. In an attempt to find a possible solution, the tools and workflows developed provide the possibility of embedding alternative scenarios into these reality captured base datasets in order to not only visually represent these scenarios, but also to directly interface them with quantitative performance models to test their effectiveness. The goal is to find a way to convince stakeholders that an alternative flood mitigation strategy is a possibility – other than the planned canalisation of the river – while uncovering the potentials of using point cloud data to do so.

**The Speaker**  
Ervine Lin is on the final leg of his journey as a doctoral student with ETH Zurich after completing his Master of Landscape Architecture with the National University of Singapore. Ervine’s research interests revolve around the use of emerging technological advancements in aiding designers and planners to find more holistc approaches to managing degraded environments.
