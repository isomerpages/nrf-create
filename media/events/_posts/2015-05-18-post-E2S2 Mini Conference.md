The Energy and Environmental Sustainability Solutions for Megacities (E2S2-CREATE) programme will be holding a mini-conference in conjunction with our mid-term review. There will be parallel presentations by our four different project groups in the area of waste management, emerging contaminants, system modeling and data sensing & sharing, followed by lunch and poster session. We welcome anyone from the CREATE community who are interested in our research to come and join us. Please register at the link below by 30 April and we look forward to your presence at our event.
