The launch of the Intra-CREATE Science, Technology, Prototyping, Policy and Practice (STP3) Workshop 2019 was officiated by Dr Cheong Wei Yang, deputy CEO of the National Research Foundation on 10 June. This was followed by a panel discussion on the theme of “The Future of Urban Society” moderated by Dr Cheong.

The high-powered panel consists of Prof. Marc Angélil, Professor for Architecture and Design at ETH Zurich and instructor of the STP3 workshop; Prof. Cheryl Chung, co-director for executive education at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP), National University of Singapore (NUS); Dr Oliver Inderwildi, visiting researcher at Cambridge Centre for Advanced Research and Education in Singapore (CARES); Prof. Joseph Liow, dean of the College of Humanities at the faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Nanyang Technological University (NTU); Prof. Maria-Elisabeth Michel-Beyerle, CEO of TUMCREATE (established by Technical University Munich); and Prof. Gerhard Schmitt, director of the Singapore-ETH Centre.

Over two weeks, 48 graduate students from ETH Zurich, MIT, Cambridge, TU Munich, NTU, NUS and SUTD will jointly explore the theme of “The Future of Urban Society” through a series of lectures, visits, discussions and design thinking workshops. The workshop will culminate in an exhibition and presentation, when student participants will present solutions and prototypes developed in response to the theme”

The STP3 workshop is a reinvention of the last three editions of the Science, Technology and Policy (STP) workshop, with design thinking as a new element, led by Professor Prof Marc Angélil. It is organised by the Singapore-ETH Centre, together with CARES, TUMCREATE, NUS, NTU, and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP).
