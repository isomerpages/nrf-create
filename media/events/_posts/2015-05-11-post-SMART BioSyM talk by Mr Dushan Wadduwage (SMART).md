**New Common path interferometer design for high-throughput wide-field spectral imaging**

  
**Seminar Abstract**  
Imaging Fourier transform spectroscopy (IFTS) is a powerful method for resolving complex spectra especially from unknown endogenous molecules. IFTS can be operated in wide-field mode allowing its use with many high throughput, high content image cytometers. There are a number of limitations in existing wide field IFTS designs. Non-common path designs are often phase unstable. Alternatively, designs based on common-path Sagnac interferometer are very stable and are commonly used. However Sagnac designs can only be operated in exhaustive sequential acquisition modes and hence are incompatible with high throughput imaging.  
  
In this talk we present a novel phase stable common-path interferometer with the aim for full-field IFTS that allows strategic data acquisition. Our simulations suggest that the instrument is order of magnitudes faster for wide-field spectral measurements.  
  
**Speaker's Biography**  
Dushan is a doctoral student at National University of Singapore under Singapore-MIT Alliance fellowship at SMART. He received his B.Sc. in Engineering (First Class Honours) from Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. He worked at the same department as a temporary lecturer before joining SMART. His research interests include optical bioimaging, imaging spectroscopy, biomedical image processing and image cytometry.
