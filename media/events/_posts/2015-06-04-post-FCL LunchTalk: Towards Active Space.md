**SEC-FCL LunchTalk:**
======================

**Towards Active Space**
========================

Since Zeus made Atlas to separate Uranus and Gaia, we know that the two spheres of form and content have to be kept apart to enable development.  
  
Today, we conceive the field as the systemic entanglement of form and content. But the field gives an answer to a question never formulated. Systems fail when paradigms change and digitisation has to be considered as such.  
  
But we know how Principle of Expulsion works: Reduce rules to the absolute necessary and set free the creative potential.  
  
Again, form and content needs to be separated, to be rejoined in arbitrary but appropriate relation.
