The first International Conference on Infrastructure Resilience is a meeting place for scientists, policy makers, and infrastructure professionals to share the latest knowledge on infrastructure resilience.

 Resilience is still an emerging concept, and together, the [Future Resilient Systems](http://frs.ethz.ch/) and the [ETH Risk Center](http://www.riskcenter.ethz.ch/) aim to further develop it through this inaugural conference. The conference brings together distinguished speakers in the field of resilience, including:

*   **Prof Kathleen M. Sutcliffe**, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor, Johns Hopkins University
*   **Prof Barry W. Boehm**, Chief Scientist, DoD Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC)
*   **Dr Brian Walker**, Honorary Fellow, CSIRO & Visiting Professor, Fenner School, Australian National University

 The ETH Risk Center Forum will feature:

*   **Prof Dr Bozidar Stojadinovic**, Professor of Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, ETH Zurich
*   **Prof Dr David N. Bresch**, Professor for Weather and Climate Risks, Institute for Environmental Decisions, ETH Zurich/ MeteoSwiss/ Risk Center
*   **Prof Dr Giovanni Sansavini**, Professor of Reliability and Risk Engineering, Institute of Energy Technology, ETH Zurich
*   **Prof Dr Bruno Sudret**, Professor of Risk, Safety and Uncertainty Quantification, ETH Zurich

 Through technical sessions and poster exhibition we will explore key topics on resilience:

*   Organisational Resilience
*   Resilience Assessment
*   Resilience Improvement
*   Robustness and Vulnerability
*   Concepts of Resilience
