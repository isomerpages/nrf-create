Event Venue: Tower Building, Level 2, CREATE Seminar Room

The November edition for the Monthly Seminar Series by CREATE PIs will be held on 6 Nov 2015, 11am at the CREATE Seminar Room. This session will be chaired by Prof Peter Edwards, Director of the Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC).

The speakers are:

**Prof Hans Heinimann** who will be sharing on the **Future Resilient Systems** programme.

“Future Resilient Systems” (FRS) addresses the challenges with critical infrastructure systems that provide essential services to modern societies, which is of particular importance to innovation-driven economies like Singapore and Switzerland. The FRS approaches infrastructure from a socio-technical system perspective, integrating engineered, operational, and user subsystems, thereby building bridges between disciplines and patterns of thought. The FRS provides a cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural environment to jointly explore approaches to make critical infrastructure systems more robust and resilient.

and

**Prof Stephen Cairns** who will be sharing on the **Future Cities Laboratory** Phase 2 programme.

This talk will outline the Future Cities Laboratory, Phase 2 research programme (2015-2020). It will address some of the primary motivations for the programme, discuss some of the core approaches to working across disciplinary boundaries, and outline a number of the research projects. The talk will look at some of the distinctive aspects of the programme, including its focus on science, design and locality.

We hope to see you there. Thank you.
