**Light scattering in 3D particle imaging**
===========================================

By Dr. Hoang Thanh Xuan, Postdoctoral Researcher  
Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology

### Seminar Abstract:

The nature of light has drawn attention of most of the greatest scientists. After a long history of debating, today light is known to exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties. In this seminar, we discuss how to exploit the light properties in improving the accuracy of estimating positions and sizes of the particulates in multi-phase flows.  
  
Recently, whispering gallery resonator sensors are extensively researched with applications, such as temperature sensing, gas sensing, biosensing, and lasing. However, the light coupling between individual resonators is poorly understood in terms of fundamental modes. In this presentation, we also discuss two physical mechanisms of optical coupling between these individual micro-resonators.  
  

### Speaker's Biography:

Hoang Thanh Xuan is a postdoctoral researcher at SMART-CENSAM. He joined the optical group at SMART in 2014 where he has been working under the supervision of Prof. George Barbastathis (MIT). At SMART, he is developing a rigorous analytical modeling of light scattering in 3D particle imaging systems.  
  
Xuan holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering from National University of Singapore where he also obtained his bachelor degree in 2010. He is interested in applying mathematics and physics in solving practical problems. He has spent the last five years studying light scattering in various imaging systems. He is also passionate about playing sports and reading history.
