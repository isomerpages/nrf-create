The CREATE Symposium puts the spotlight on Climate Change and brings together expertise from CREATE and our collaborators to share insights on this urgent challenge. Approaching climate change from the perspectives of 1) mitigation, 2) adaptation and 3) policy and planning, speakers will discuss carbon capture, storage and utilisation, utilising our natural assets for climate mitigation, Singapore’s role in the Global Climate Change Movement and urban strategies for thermal comfort.
