**Confocal reflectance quantitative phase microscope for studying cell and nuclear membranes mechanics**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Seminar Abstract**  
In order to generate the contrast in unstained cell, phase resolved techniques are available. Over the past two decades, significant advancement of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) have been made, which allow measurement of cellular plasma membrane fluctuation with resolutions on the scale of nanometres and milliseconds, and used for staging of malaria parasite infection of red blood cells (RBCs). The developed QPM methods are mainly transmission based and have good sensitivity and speed but these methods lack three-dimensional (3D) resolution.  
  
Studies show that changes in nuclear mechanics are accompanied by defects in gene expression and a distorted nuclear morphology. Mostrecently, it is shown that the nuclear membrane deformation is suggested as a marker for isolating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow. Among the several other biophysical markers considered for MSCs, it was found that cell stiffness and nuclear membrane fluctuations correlated strongly with multipotency.  
  
In this talk a newly developed confocal reflectance quantitative phase microscopy system is presented, that can be used to study the biomechanics of intracellular level structures. This reflection phase microscope will enable non-invasive, marker-free, 3D dynamic imaging of dimensional fluctuations of both the cellular plasma and nuclei membranes.
