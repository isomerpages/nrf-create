Speculating what Paradise looks like is one of the longest continuous discussion of an imagined landscape. Where is it located? How does this promised eternal space looks like?  
  
Long conversations about the physicality of Paradise is an attraction for Faiz Bin Zohri; as a way to reflect how we imagine nature and how this spiritual (sometimes voyeuristic or super-terrestrial) visualisations is define by the real world, our own culture, new scientific discoveries, or as ways to search for lost tradition. With this, let us go for a “walk” – sometimes factual and sometimes with our own imaginations – looking at various paradises through paintings, maps and films.
