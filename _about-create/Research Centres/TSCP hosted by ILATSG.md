 About Trustworthy and Secure Cyber Plexus (TSCP) 

The Trustworthy and Secure Cyber Plexus (TSCP) is a joint programme between the Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The programme also will collaborate with the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University, the Institute for Infocomm Research, and other research agencies at Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR).The TSCP programme will focus on four main thrusts:

*   System architecture and the organization of trustworthy and secure cybersecurity components and their interactions;
*   Development of new hardware, software, protocols and applications;
*   Standards, verification and validation of components and
*   Methodologies and tools to continuously monitor, detect and react to problems in real-time.

The TSCP Programme is led by Prof David Nicol, the Franklin W. Woeltge Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and director of the Information Trust Institute. Prof Zbigniew Kalbarczyk, a research professor of electrical and computer engineering in the Coordinated Science Laboratory, will share the leadership role.
