# About TUM CREATE

TUM CREATE is an electromobility research project undertaken by two world-leading universities, Germany’s Technische Universität München (TUM) and Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University (NTU), funded by the National Research Foundation of Singapore. TUM CREATE is part of NRF’s Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise. 

At TUM CREATE over 120 scientists, researchers and engineers from more than 20 countries are working on cutting-edge research that covers topics ranging from the molecule to the megacity including areas such as: electrochemistry, electric vehicle batteries, embedded systems, air conditioning, simulation and modelling, and infrastructure.

*   We aim to support the integration of e-vehicles into Singapore’s transportation system:
*   Improve energy storage and energy management systems needed for electromobility.
*   Designing new e-vehicle concepts for test-bedding innovative technologies.
*   Developing models for optimisation towards efficient future transportation systems.

Our research will help to improve Singapore’s roadways, vehicles and public transport network.
