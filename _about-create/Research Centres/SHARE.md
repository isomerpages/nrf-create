**Singapore-HUJ Alliance for Research and Enterprise (SHARE)**

 

SHARE was established in 2016 to advance and strengthen research collaborations between Israel and Singapore. SHARE serves as an intellectual hub for  research, scholarship, entrepreneurship and postgraduate/postdoctoral training, bringing together leading scientists from both countries to tackle major global challenges . It is the only international research center of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem outside of Israel.

Currently, SHARE has two major research projects.

**Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Inflammatory Diseases (MMID)** is a joint research project between HUJ and NUS. The research aims to develop understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of inflammation which will accelerate the development of diagnostic/prognostic indicators and novel therapeutics for common inflammatory diseases in Asia and elsewhere. 

**Nanomaterials for Energy and Water Management (NEW)** is a joint research project between HUJ and NTU, to develop **novel materials** and devices for three themes: printable energy materials and devices, energy modulation and storage systems for buildings, and materials and processes for energy-water nexus. This project aims to innovate advanced materials in pushing the scientific frontiers in energy harvesting, conservation and storage and meet the energy-water nexus needs through **innovative manufacturing processes.**
