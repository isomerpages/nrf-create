## Overview

CREATE was officially opened by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 16 November 2012. Situated in the National University of Singapore’s University Town (NUS U-Town), CREATE is in the vicinity of the other Singapore high tech centres such as Biopolis, Fusionopolis and the Science Parks. It has a gross floor area of 67,000 square metres in four buildings that will house some 1,200 researchers.

## Features
--------

The buildings at CREATE were designed to pioneer the use of environmental sustainability and energy efficient technologies in buildings in the tropics. It is the first scientific facility to be awarded Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority (BCA)’s Green Mark Platinum Award. The wet laboratories are located in the low-rise wings, while dry labs and offices are in a high-rise tower. Lab spaces and corridors are located at the perimeter of buildings so that less artificial lighting is needed. The buildings feature energy saving solutions to minimise the need for energy. The efficient water treatment facility reduces dependence on municipal water through the treatment and re-use of rainwater and grey water from showers and lavatories. Other design elements include:

*   Improved glazed windows to reduce solar transmission
*   Sunshades and motorised internal roller blinds to maximise daylight and reduce heat glare
*   Solar panels embedded on building facade and rooftops to harness solar power
*   Verdant sky gardens and vertical foliage provide ambient cooling

CREATE was named the “2013 Laboratory of the Year” by the US-based R&D Magazine. CREATE has been recognised for its excellence in research laboratory design, planning, and construction, and is the third R&D facility outside of the United States, and the first in East Asia to win this honour.
