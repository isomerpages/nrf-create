### In Brief

  
CREATE is working towards an evolved model of partnerships that encourages greater multi-lateral collaborations. The thematic grant call on the “Intersection of Public Health and the Environment” aims to promote research collaborations beyond the CREATE network by encouraging CREATE Partners to submit joint applications with Principal Investigators from other overseas universities.  
  
Proposals should take into consideration Singapore’s unique context as a trade/travel hub with a highly dense multicultural urban population and limited land space to identify direct and indirect urban environmental drivers that affect the physical and mental health of various age groups within the Singapore population.  
  
Outcomes should include actionable recommendations, policies and/or interventions that integrate surveillance and prevention with better design of environmental and community spaces, socio-behavioural sciences, and/or effective communication strategies that will result in a positive impact on public health.  
  

###   
Funding and Duration

  
Joint projects can be funded up to S$5 million over 3 years.
